# QuantConnect Backtesting

This directory is for the three scripts we developed to run on the QuantConnect platform.

1. `corma_basic.py` - Novel CORRMA indicator and trading algorithm. Swap assets when below threshold.
2. `corrma_advanced.py` - "Advanced" CORRMA-based algorithm. Swap assets when below threshold. Swap back to original when below 0.0.
3. `benchmark.py` - B&H Benchmark file.
